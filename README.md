# 🧠 Neural Network From Scratch — Pure Python

> No NumPy. No TensorFlow. No shortcuts. Just Python and Maths.

Build a fully working neural network from absolute zero — weights, forward pass, backpropagation, gradient descent, all of it. By the end, the network learns to solve the XOR problem on its own.

## 🎯 What This Covers

- What a neuron is and how it works mathematically
- Sigmoid activation function
- Building a Layer and a full NeuralNetwork class
- Forward pass — how data flows through the network
- Loss function — Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Backpropagation — chain rule explained and coded
- Gradient descent — how weights get updated
- Full training loop — watch the loss drop in real time
- Solving the XOR problem — a classic non-linear task

## 🧮 Key Formulas

```
Neuron output:       z = (w1×x1) + (w2×x2) + ... + bias
Sigmoid:             σ(z) = 1 / (1 + e^−z)
Sigmoid derivative:  σ'(z) = σ(z) × (1 − σ(z))
MSE Loss:            L = (1/n) × Σ(y − ŷ)²
Weight update:       w = w + α × δ × x
```

## ▶️ How to Run

**Option 1 — Jupyter Notebook (recommended)**
```bash
jupyter notebook neural_network_from_scratch.ipynb
```

**Option 2 — VS Code**
Open the `.ipynb` file directly in VS Code with the Jupyter extension.

**Option 3 — Google Colab**
Upload the file to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com) and run all cells.

No installations needed — only Python standard library (`math`, `random`).

## 📓 Notebook Structure

| Cell | Topic |
|------|-------|
| 1 | Imports |
| 2 | Neuron class |
| 3 | Layer class |
| 4 | NeuralNetwork class (forward + backward + update) |
| 5 | XOR dataset |
| 6 | Loss function (MSE) |
| 7 | Backprop verification |
| 8 | Training loop |
| 9 | ASCII loss curve |
| 10 | Final test — all 4 XOR predictions |
| 11 | Bonus experiments (learning rates, hidden sizes) |

---

## 🧪 Bonus Experiments (inside the notebook)

**Try different learning rates:**
```
lr=0.1  → trains slowly
lr=0.5  → sweet spot
lr=2.0  → might overshoot
```

**Try different hidden layer sizes:**
```
[2, 2, 1]  → barely enough neurons
[2, 8, 1]  → more capacity
[2, 16, 1] → overkill for XOR, but works
```
